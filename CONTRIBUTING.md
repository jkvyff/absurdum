## Ground Rules

1. You must use reduce in your solution, (ie no map/filter/foreach)
2. Your solution must be functional (ie no side-effects)
3. Recursion is be allowed for nested data types
4. Be mindful of performance/memory
5. VanillaJS only
6. Forget DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), keep modules self-contained
